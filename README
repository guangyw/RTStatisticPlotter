Right now the server can only be run on Linux.
The plotter uses matplotlib. So, numpy and matplotlib need to be installed.

Suggested way to install matplotlib and numpy:

sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-matplotlib

The server is written in Twisted python. So, twisted python should be installed.

The test client is just a simple socket program. It is a dummy data generator that connected to the server to test the system. It is cross-platform.

Run server.py first to start the server
Then run test_client.py. It is a dummy data generator that connected to the server to test the system.
Whenever a client connected, the server will display what clients are connected right now, and let the user choose which stream to display
The user entered a num, and a stream of data whose client index in the memory of server, will be displayed.

In the Display window, click on any point of the graph to find out the exact x, y value of that point.

Average, minimum, maximum values of this stream are displayed in the right bottom corner.

You can change the display canvass to the way you like, by setting the max and min value of x and y axises.

You can save the current canvass to file.
