This is only a proto type of our project. 
It is not fully functional yet.


Run server.py first to start the server
Then run test_client.py. It is a dummy data generator that connected to the server to test the system.
Whenever a client connected, the server will display what clients are connected right now, and let the user choose which stream to display
The user entered a num, and a stream of data whose client index in the memory of server, will be displayed
